# It's PowerShell in the Cloud - Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell

You already know PowerShell is the key to on-premises workloads. Now take the power of the shell into the Cloud with Azure Cloud Shell. This demo-packed session will introduce you to Azure Cloud Shell, and provide plenty of tips to be immediately effective in using the command line to manage your Azure resources from anywhere.

**Note for PowerShell+DevOps Summit 2023 Attendees**
This will be updated in the near future to match the talk given at Summit this year. Stay Tuned!
